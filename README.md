# Auto-Tinder-Swiper

Automatically logs you into Tinder Via FB, and then 'swipes' right on everyone. It can get rid of the popups and then continue 'swiping'


As I couldn't get the program to simply click the like button, i had to resort to sending the Right-Arrow to the page to 'swipe'. However, as this was being sent to the page as a whole it took no notice of a popup and thus no errors could be picked up. I fixed this by making it click the screen after every attempted swipe to ensure that any popups will be closed. However, it remains to be seen if this will work on if the 'Its a Match' screen arises as i don't know if this is a popup or not.
