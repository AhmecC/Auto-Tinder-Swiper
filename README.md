# Auto-Tinder-Swiper

Description:
> Automatically logs you into Tinder Via FB, and then 'swipes' right on everyone. It can get rid of poups and also remove the 'Its a Match' screen, allowing for a smooth experience.


Encountered Problems:
> The id in the XPATH seems to change every day and thus has to be manually changed. I have included 2 constants to easily swap them out, and the IDs are easily found by inspecting the main page
