# Auto-Tinder-Swiper

Automatically logs you into Tinder Via FB, and then 'swipes' right on everyone. It can get rid of poups and also remove the 'Its a Match' screen, allowing for a smooth experience.


Problem:
- I found that the id (as found in the XPATH) changes and so may have to be manually changed for it to work.
