# Auto-Tinder-Swiper

This Automatically Logs you into Tinder Via Facebook Login (Hence why the user must have their FB account linked to their Tinder)

It Automatically Swipes right on everyone and if a popup arises as a match occurs it will bypass. This Programme runs until you end it yourself or you run out of swipes

NOTE OF DIFFICULTY:
- Could not figure out how to press the like button on the card as a means of 'swiping right' and instead had to resort to using the Right Arrow to create the effect.
